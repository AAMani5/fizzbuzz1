Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming

<p>What is Fizzbuzz?</p>
<p>Fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge, often described as a code kata. The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:</p>

- The method can be used with any Integer.
- When called on a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'fizz'.
- When called on a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'buzz'.
- When called on a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'fizzbuzz'.
- e.g ```3.fizzbuzz # => fizz```
