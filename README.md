Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming

<p>What is Fizzbuzz?</p>
<p>Fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge, often described as a code kata. The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:</p>

- The program can be passed a parameter - number or any other type.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
- When passed any other number, the program simply returns the given number.
In all other cases(string, array etc), the program simply returns an error message.
